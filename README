Copyright 2009 by Alan Munn <amunn@msu.edu>
based on code in vowel.sty Copyright 2002 by Rei Fukui

This package insert nodes for use with pstricks so that arrows can 
be drawn to show diphthongs on vowel charts created with vowel.sty.

For cardinal vowels, the change is minimal, since predefined node
labels are used. For non-cardinal vowels, an extra node argument
must be provided.
